- game.cpp: An end game screen should be created
- game.cpp: Restrict keyboard focus to the bounding rectangle of all possible bridge building points, not the map size
    this allows maps containing 'islands' going outside the screen and covering the entire edge ("mainland")
- game.cpp: The pop_welldone_kb message needs k_confirm named (and spaces to recenter it)
- maps.cpp: Need to design some levels containing the new objects
    generator isn't enough, I want a few mainlands
    make sure to introduce the new objects in a reasonable way
    ideally, there should be three new worlds with three tilesets; one can be sandy, fg5 can be same as fg0, and the last one is undecided
- solver.cpp: Implement hint system (remove all incorrect bridges?)
- solver.cpp: Maps should be considered unambiguous if all solutions have the same number of bridges between islands A and B,
    to avoid handing out "this one is either 0 or 4" hints to people who know how generator works
    for example, this map should be unambiguous
      2 2
      ^ ^
    to do that, make solver always move same-island-pair bridges up/left, if possible
      and if both edges are straight (to avoid issues with L-shaped islands where the bridge in the hole must go the other way)
    alternatively, ban generator from creating maps where the situation shows up
    alternatively, just leave it like this, generator will never be perfect
